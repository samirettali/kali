# My Kali setup for CTFs

This is my Kali Linux setup for CTFs.

It uses Vagrant to create the virtual machine and Ansible to install and
configure the software and the tools.

It is based on the Light version of the Kali image.

To download and build the virtual machine you just have to run the command
```vagrant up```
